   child care Foundation, an Indian social development organization, is directly benefitting over 15 lakh children and their families every year. We have more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood, and women’s empowerment in over 2,000 remote villages and urban slums across 25 states of India.<br>

The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. However, a child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially the mother, would be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.<br>

Education empowers an individual to earn their livelihood and also increases one's awareness on a range of issues. From healthcare, to appropriate social behavior, to understanding one's rights – Smile Foundation seeks to educate, empower and cultivate better citizens.<br>

    Children have the potential to bring incredible change to our world. But first, we need to recognise their value. These sayings about children encourage us to give them our loving care and attention.<br>

    “Every child is an artist.” <br>

    “Let us reach out to the children. Let us do whatever we can to support their fight to rise above their pain and suffering.”<br>

    “Children are more than we think they are; they can do more than we think they can do. All they need is a vote of confidence from grownups, whom they will ultimately replace anyway. Their dream today will become the realities of tomorrow.”<br>

</p>
 <br>

 "Only where children gather is there any real chance of fun.”
